# Project Title: KMP (Knuth Morris Pratt)

`KMP is Substring Pattern Searching Algorithm`

## Details 


* KMP has the nice advantage that it is guaranteed worst-case efficient.
* The preprocessing time is always O(n), and the searching time is always `O(m)`.
* There are no worst-case inputs, no probability of getting unlucky.


## Algorithm

```
algorithm kmp_search: 
    input:
        an array of characters, S (the text to be searched)
        an array of characters, W (the word sought)
    output:
        an array of integers, P (positions in S at which W is found)
        an integer, nP (number of positions)

    define variables:
        an integer, j ← 0 (the position of the current character in S)
        an integer, k ← 0 (the position of the current character in W)
        an array of integers, T (the table, computed elsewhere)

    let nP ← 0

    while j < length(S) do
        if W[k] = S[j] then
            let j ← j + 1
            let k ← k + 1
            if k = length(W) then
                (occurrence found, if only first occurrence is needed, m ← j - k  may be returned here)
                let P[nP] ← j - k, nP ← nP + 1
                let k ← T[k] (T[length(W)] can't be -1)
        else
            let k ← T[k]
            if k < 0 then
                let j ← j + 1
                let k ← k + 1 
```
